-Description:

	Around 16.00 PM local time (GMT Western Indonesian Region), I noticed a popular hashtag called '#KemenkesAntekAsing' in Indonesia region.
	It implies of an accussation to the Indonesian Minister of Health being a foreign agent. This accusation is directed to the minister plan to
	join an 'initiative' from the Bloomberg L.P. about smoking. The initiative in question is called 'Bloomberg Initiative To Reduce Tobacco Use'. 

	This initiative is aimed to help amplifying the United Nation World Health Organisation (WHO) program to reduce tobacco related deaths.
	The program in question is called MPOWER; an abbreviation of the followings
	- Monitor; monitor tobacco use and prevention policies
	- Protect; protect people from tobacco smoke
	- Offer; offer help to quit
	- Warn; warn about the dangers tobacco
	- Enforce; enforce bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship
	- Raise; raise taxes on tobacco
  
	Further details can be read through the following link: (https://tobaccocontrolgrants.org/About-the-BI-Grants-Program).

  Indonesia is one of the ten countries with high prevalence use of tobacco prioritised by the Bloomberg to join this program.

-Updates: 

	(1). 18.40 PM local time; Aprroximately 3,500 Indonesian tweeted #KemenkesAntekAsing

-Editor Opinion: 

  "A potentially malicious disinformation campaign run by the tobacco industrialists social media team to protect their interest in Indonesia.
  Whether it is run by both domestic or foreign tobacco industrialists are currently unknown."
