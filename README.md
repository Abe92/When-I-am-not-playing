# When-I-am-not-playing
The collection of small projects done when I am not playing video games <br>

## Folder(s) description
(1). **2019** <br>
   This folder was intended to be a form of `log/logbook` of interesting event(s) that occurs in Indonesia. At the time, I noticed there are two **interesting** months in 2019.
   On **June 2019**, a smear campaign was launched to discredit Indonesian Health Minister effort to reduce the `smoking habit` among Indonesian. While **July 2019**, a local government in my hometown gave a `greenlight` for electric vehicles to operate and its potential to boost local economy. A much needed opportunity to reduce the number of unemployments, but also raise a concern possessed by the `noiseless machine` of electric vehicles. Some people is worried about its potential to raise the number of traffic accident. <br>

(2). **2020** <br>
   This folder hold the most recently ressurected project of mine, with the aim to build a data visualization of **Nobel Prize Winners**. This visualization will be build using `Python graphing libraries` such as **Plotly**. It may also extend to developed a dashboard version of it using another graphing libraries such as **Dash**. <br>
   
(3). **Histories** <br>
     This folder contains the record of my attempt to further my educations and professional careers. It recorded the events of the journey from 2016 till present (i.e. `2020`) in ascending order. The update frequency of the list is plan to be at least every month; should updates exist. <br>
     
(4). **Programming** <br>
     This folder is specifically build to showcase my programming skills in using `Python` and `SQL` or other programming language(s) in the future. It also showcases the result of the programming languages in question, e.g. `PNGs` and `HTMLs`. Again, the list may grow in the future. Some of the notable **results** stored here are: <br>
      - Plotly outputs (in `HTMLs` and `PNGs`) of Oxford University COVID-19 Government Response Tracker and <br>
      - Plotly scripts to build those outputs (`HTMLs` and `PNGs`).
